[x] Add douira angle culling
[x] Add fog culling
    - use vector sqrt for circle rasterization
    - mirror sqrt value to get both positions
[x] Get rid of morton indexing, allow Y to be a non-po2 to save memory
  - Maybe make all axis non-po2? Is it worth the perf hit?
[x] Change direction iteration order to make access patterns more linear
[x] Deal with worlds that don't have a height that aligns to a tile
[x] Organize code by cull type, split out context and tests
[x] Fix bad frustum cull results, even if performance is degraded (use div, it's not the end of the world)
[x] Fix being above or below world height
    - what do we do for the starting tile when out of bounds?
    - do we need to clamp the start tile position? probably only for some things.
    - double-check the iteration step lengths are correct
    - add assertions
[ ] Replicate what addNearbySections does
[ ] Clean up full-tile fog culling
[-] Document code better
